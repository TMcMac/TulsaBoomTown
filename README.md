# Tulsa BoomTown

### Summery
Hi, thanks for checking out the repo for our project TulsaBoomTown.tech

This project was the final submission for Reese Hicks, Tim McMacken, Blake Stewart, and Jacob Wagner for Holberton Tulsa, Cohort 12. The concept for this project is to bring more attention to the growing tech sector in Tulsa Oklahoma and highlighted some of the great things about our city. Our mission of amplifying the message that Tulsa is the next great American tech city led us to focus on 4 major factors that we want to share with everyone.

1. There are great companies already here doing cool work, many of which need more tech talent to join their teams and help them grow. For this factor, we built the T-Combinator portion of the page, which highlights local companies in dynamically generated cards.
2. There are opportunities to relocate to Tulsa from elsewhere and these include the remote work program Tulsa Remote, and the tech engineering school Holberton.
3. That there are some great associations and tech-focused groups here in Tulsa, including the remote working space 36 Degrees North, the new incubator 5th floor, and groups like OK Women in Tech
4. There are plenty of jobs both remote and local here in Tulsa for entrepreneurs and tech workers.

We built these foci into our home page at tulsaboomtown.tech so that we could amplify the message that Tulsa is a tech boomtown and a great place to move to as it reinvents itself. 

In addition to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up our website we also utilized several python scripts for pulling remote jobs data, via the remotive.io API and a web scraping tool targeted at okjobmatch.com. WE pushed all this data to a MySQLdb database in a series of tables that we were able to query for our dynamic content. 

Finally, we used python and the tweepy package to build out a Twitter bot that would further amplify our message and life Tulsa up. Our bot goes by the handle @TulsaBoomTown and you can interact with it on twitter.com
